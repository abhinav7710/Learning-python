#Trying a function based question
'''Write a function increment() that has a local variable counter initialized to
0 and increments it by 1 each time it is called. Observe whether the value
persists across function calls'''

counter = 0
def increment():
    global counter
    counter +=1
    return counter
print(increment())
print(increment())
